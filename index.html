                <p class="para1">Royal College, located in Horana, is a prestigious school that places a strong emphasis
                    on academic excellence. The school offers a comprehensive and well-rounded curriculum that focuses
                    on three key areas: science, IT, and math.
                    In the science program, students are taught a range of subjects including biology, chemistry, and
                    physics. Through hands-on experiments, students develop a deep understanding of scientific concepts
                    and learn how to apply them to real-world problems.
                    In the IT program, students are taught the fundamentals of computer science and programming
                    languages. They learn how to design and build software applications, websites, and other digital
                    solutions using industry-standard tools and technologies.
                    In the maths program, students are challenged to think critically and logically as they explore the
                    principles of algebra, geometry, and calculus. They learn problem-solving techniques and
                    mathematical modeling that enable them to analyze complex situations and find solutions.
                    Overall, Royal College provides a rigorous academic program that prepares students for success in
                    higher education and beyond. With a focus on science, IT, and maths, students gain the knowledge and
                    skills they need to pursue a wide range of careers in fields such as engineering, technology,
                    medicine, and research.</p>
